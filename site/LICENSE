Contributers to this repo have to follow these Dev Ethics:
{1} Anything that happens in Dev Chats STAY in Dev Chats
{2} Stuff that happens outside the server do not and should not affect stuff in this server
{3} Staff should take criticism and work upon it instead of silencing
{4} Demotions and moderative actions should be thought about and talked about with the entire moderation team before taking action
{5} If a contributor says something is a lie/fake/joke assume it is, no matter how suspicious
{6} Do everything in your power to keep a developer on the team, unless all staff request their demotion
{7} Rules 5 and 6 can be overriden in the case of:
Illegal Content/Contributions
License Violations
