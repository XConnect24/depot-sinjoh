# [Spectrum](https://spectrum.optick.io)
> A collection of CSS classes for rapid front-end development

## Installation

The best way to include Spectrum in your project is to use a CDN:

```css
/* Imported into a CSS file. */
@import('https://spectrum.optick.io/latest/spectrum-full.min.css')
```

or

```html
<!-- Directly linked within an HTML page -->
<link href="https://spectrum.optick.io/latest/spectrum-full.min.css" />
```

If you want to consolidate the CSS in your project or choose which modules to
import, use NPM:

```bash
npm install spectrum-css --save-dev
```

You can then import files directly within your SCSS file:

```scss
@import '~spectrum-css/src/scss/spectrum-core';
@import '~spectrum-css/src/scss/modules/additional/border/width';
```

## Build Setup

``` bash
# Install dependencies.
npm install

# Serve with hot reload at http://localhost:8888.
npm run dev

# Build for production with minification.
npm run build

# Run all tests.
npm test
```
